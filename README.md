# WebDev_Proj1
This was my first WebDev minor project I did in 2021 revolving around an ANIME MERCHANDISE STORE, Although it is incomplete right now, it includes basic HTML, and some clean CSS Code,  I am also adding some blueprint Codesheets on which I learnt html and css for reference, and I Visioned to add in a streaming platform on to this site as well, so I might work on this in future again.

Signing off,
Aditya
